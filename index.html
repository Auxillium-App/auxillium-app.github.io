            <h3>About "Auxillium"</h3>

            <p>Gender-based violence, which occurs in every country, territory and region of the world, is a violation
                of basic rights that also prevents women from exercising their other social, economic and political
                rights. Globally, 35 percent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence.</p>
            <p>
                However, gender-based violence is neither inevitable nor acceptable. Gender-based violence or violence
                against women and girls is a global pandemic that affects 1 in 3 women in their lifetime.As many as 38%
                of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.
                Based on the results of our survey, about 71% of women in Uzbekistan are subjected to gender-based
                violence. Most often, the violence is psychological - 85% of all cases, physical - 68%, economic - 49%
                and sexual - 19%.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 77 per cent of cases of violence, the victim is a married woman, 49 per cent a teenage girl, 35 per
                cent a divorced woman and 31 per cent unmarried girls.
                Who do you think is the most likely person to commit violence against a woman? Most often violence is
                committed by the victim's partner and his family, which makes 74.5 per cent of all cases, in 29 per cent
                it is the father and other male relatives, in the remaining 34 per cent it is the outsider men. And in
                most cases the reason for violence is low cultural level and alcoholism as well as material and housing
                problems.
                </p>
            <p>
                If we come to the essence of the problem, it is that 60% of the victims of violence do not seek help and
                79% of the complainants seek help from relatives or friends.
                </p>
            <p>
                It is very difficult for a woman who has been subjected to abuse to report it to someone because they
                are afraid of being publicized and condemned. The only right solution to this problem is to consult a
                psychologist and work on their mental health. But according to our mentality, it is not accepted to
                discuss problems in the family with outsiders. We, the "Science of Happiness" team, came up with this
                solution, which resulted in the Auxilium application. It means "help" in Latin. The application combines
                an anonymous chat with a psychologist, numbers of psychological centers, as well as SOS-button for
                emergency cases. The main advantage of our application is to remain anonymous. The data entered during
                registration are not subject to publicity and are not voiced. According to our research, there are no
                alternative applications in Uzbekistan yet.</p>
